# Spelling Practice Ver2

**_This version of Spelling Practice uses ASP.NET MVC and C# instead of Python._**

----

The spelling practice application helps kids learn and practice 
spelling up to 10 vocabulary words at a time.

The user inputs the spelling words or chooses the words saved from the 
last session. The website then helps set up the text to be read
by an [online text-to-speech application](https://www.text2speech.org/).
The user inputs the answers to the Spelling Practice webpage and results
of the practice test is displayed
